# vocechat_client

VoceChat client app is a pure front-end to browse your self-hosted Voce server.

There are two ways to delete your data.

1. Open your server URL at a browser to login to your web front-end. Go to My Account -> Delete Account.
2. Go to the self-hosted Voce server database. Open terminal, type sqlite3 data/db/db.sqlite, delete the data folder.
